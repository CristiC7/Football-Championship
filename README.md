## 🧾 How It Works

### 👥 Team Model

Each `Team` contains:
- Name
- Market value (in millions)
- Wins, draws, losses
- Points are calculated: `Points = 3 × Wins + 1 × Draws`

---

### 🏆 Championship Functionalities

A `Championship` can:

- Add teams (`promoteTeam`)
- Remove teams (`relegateTeam`)
- Update team stats after matches
- Track number of completed stages
- Display:
  - Points-based standings
  - Value-based standings
  - Performance comparison reports
- Save or load all data using text files
